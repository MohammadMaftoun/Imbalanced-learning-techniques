# Imbalanced-learning-techniques
Imbalanced learning addresses the challenge posed by classification problems where one class substantially outnumbers the other, resulting in imbalanced datasets. This scenario is prevalent in domains like fraud detection, medical diagnosis, and anomaly detection.

This repository aims to provide  complete projects related to imbalanced datasets.

Here are some common imbalanced learning techniques:

    Resampling Techniques:
        Under-sampling: Remove samples from the majority class to balance the class distribution. This can be done randomly or using more sophisticated techniques like Tomek links or edited nearest neighbors.
        Over-sampling: Duplicate or generate synthetic samples for the minority class to balance the class distribution. Techniques include random over-sampling, SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), and ADASYN (Adaptive Synthetic Sampling).

    Algorithmic Techniques:
        Cost-sensitive learning: Assign different misclassification costs to different classes. This is done by adjusting the class weights during model training. Many machine learning algorithms, such as those in scikit-learn, provide an option to set class weights.
        Ensemble methods: Use ensemble methods like Random Forests or Boosting, which can handle imbalanced data naturally. Adjusting the weights of individual learners or combining multiple classifiers can improve performance.

    Algorithmic Extensions:
        Balanced Random Forest: An extension of the Random Forest algorithm that balances the class distribution by adjusting the weights during training.
        SMOTEBoost: Combines the SMOTE algorithm with boosting to generate synthetic samples for the minority class during each iteration of boosting.

    Cost-sensitive Meta-learning:
        MetaCost: A meta-learning algorithm that adjusts the misclassification costs based on the performance of the base learner.

    Anomaly Detection Techniques:
        One-Class SVM: This algorithm is designed for situations where one class is underrepresented. It learns a model of the majority class and identifies deviations from this model as anomalies.

    Evaluation Metrics:
        When evaluating models on imbalanced datasets, standard accuracy may not be a suitable metric. Instead, use metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC), or area under the precision-recall curve (AUC-PR) that provide a more comprehensive view of the model's performance on both classes.

    Data Augmentation:
        Augment the minority class by applying transformations to existing instances or generating synthetic samples. This is commonly used in image data but can be adapted for other types of data as well.
